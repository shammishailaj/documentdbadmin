#MongoAdmin

This is a tool for simple administration of your MongoDB instance. You can add and remove indexes and run simple find and find by id queries. This is not a secure or production ready solution by any stretch of the imagination. But it is a good first start, especially if you want a UI for a remote (non-production) mongodb instance. 

## Requirements

Bower is required to build the UI and Go required to build the binary.

To install bower, have node and npm install and run `npm install -g bower`

## Install & Setup

Get the Go depedencies

`go get .` 

Install the bower dependencies

`bower install`

Compile the binary in your server environment.

`go build`


Use the `sample.toml` as an example for how to configure the databases. The `label` is what shows up in the UI. `database` is the actual DB name, and `connectionString` is the string to connect to the MongoDB server. You can use replica sets, etc, whatever `mgo` will accept in `mgo.Dial`.

## Running
Just run the binary and pass the relative path to your config file as the only argument.

`./documentdbadmin sample.toml`
